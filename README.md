[00:19.13] Livin' off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
[00:22.16] That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
[00:24.46] Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
[00:26.89] A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster
[00:49.89] 
[00:29.22] I-C-E cold, nice to be old
[00:31.98] Y2G steed twice to threefold
[00:34.48] He sold scrolls, lo and behold
[00:36.96] Know who's the illest ever, like the greatest story told
[01:04.96] 
[00:40.03] Keep your glory, gold and glitter
[00:41.63] For have half of his niggaz'll take him out the picture
[00:44.24] The other half is rich and don't mean shitter
[00:46.77] Villain a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
[00:49.15] Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
[01:15.15] 
[00:51.79] When he have the mic it's like the place get like, oh-yeah
[00:54.98] It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
[00:56.73] Just keep ya eye out, like aye, aye cap'n
[00:59.16] Is he still a fly guy clappin' if nobody ain't hear it
[01:01.90] And can they testify from inner spirit? (No)
[01:05.17] In living, the true gods
[01:17.17] 
[01:06.58] Givin' y'all nothing, but the lick like two broads
[01:09.21] Got more lyrics than the church got, ooh Lords
[01:11.67] And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
[01:14.70] Or even one with two blades on it
[01:16.45] Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it
[01:19.85] It's like the end to the means
[01:21.56] Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
[01:24.77] That's why he brings his own needles
[01:26.37] And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
[01:30.14] Slip like Freudian, your first and last step to playin' yourself like accordion
[02:09.64] 
[01:39.37] When he at the mic, you don't go next
[01:41.57] Even pussycats like why hoes need Kotex
[01:43.98] Exercise index won't need Bow flex
[01:46.13] And won't take the one with no skinny legs like Joe Tex
